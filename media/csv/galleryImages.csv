2025june_lavender,"Lavender stands<br><br>
Where cracked earth yields,<br>
where dust takes flight,<br>
through purple fields,<br>
in golden light.<br><br>
Where wind unravels names,<br>
where silence sways like grass,<br>
and musing claims,<br>
shattered glass.<br><br>

first real profile picture,"I got this persona roughly around 2015. My MAL account still uses it to this day, and I've made that in Feb 2017, so it's been a while! <br><br>
Small disclaimer: This piece is *not mine*, I was super bad at drawing back then, as you'll see in other pieces. <br>
This is fanart of Ao from Akatsuki no Yona, but I sadly can't find the original artist anymore.",profile-pictures,2015-01,pfp1.png
2nd,"Dinosaur? Glob? Neither me, nor anybody else really knows what this is. I created it while drunk or high and have since totally forgotten what it was meant to be.<br><br>
It is also my first attempt at drawing my profile picture myself, and while it's obviously no artistic masterpiece, I still enjoy the picture hugely because of what I started back then.<br><br>
Created circa 2019",profile-pictures,2019-01,pfp2.png
